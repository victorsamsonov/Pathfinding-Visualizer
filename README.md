I decided to challenge myself by building upon what I had learned In my previous classes and decided to implement algorithms that I learned in Discrete Structures such as the A* Algorithm and the Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithms, both similar, although A* is a special case of Dijkstra's. For this project I improved my Javascript, CSS and even HTML knowledge, wich resulted in creating an interactive Pathfinding Visualizer that included features such as adding walls, removing walls, randomly generating walls, clearing the board and visualizing the algorithm.

As I keep improving my React and Javascript, I will update this project to add new features.
